      <h3>
      Audio: MP3 vs. WAV vs. Ogg
      </h3>
      <menu>
        <li>
        MP3: MP3 stands for MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3. It was released back in 1993 and exploded in popularity, eventually becoming the most popular audio format in the world for music files. Popular, lossy compressed format ensures small file size, but far from the best sound quality. Convenient for storing music on smartphones and iPods.
          <menu>
            <li>
              Advantages: lossy compressed format, small file size; most popular format as nearly every digital device in the world with audio playback can read and play MP3 files
            </li>
            <li>
              Disadvantages: most common lossy format; not the most efficient format
            </li>

              Lossy codecs MPEG-1 for MP3

              File Extensions: .mp3

          </menu>
 
        </li>
        <li>
          WAV: WAV stands for Waveform Audio File Format. It’s a standard that was developed by Microsoft and IBM back in 1991. Most WAV files contain uncompressed audio in PCM format. The WAV file is just a wrapper for the PCM encoding, making it more suitable for use on Windows systems. However, Mac systems can usually open WAV files without any issues.The standard format in which all CDs are encoded. Great sound quality but it's uncompressed, meaning huge file sizes. It has poor metadata support (that is, album artwork, artist and song title information).
        </li>
          <menu>
            <li>
            Advantages: uncompressed format, exact copy of the original source audio
            </li>
            <li>
            Disadvantages: take up a lot of unnecessary space on the hard drives
            </li>
            <li>
            Lossless codecs Linear Pulse Code Modulation (LPCM) for WAV
            </li>
          </menu>
        <li>
        Ogg: Sometimes called by its full name, Ogg Vorbis. A lossy, open-source alternative to MP3 and AAC, unrestricted by patents. The file format used (at 320kbps) in Spotify streaming. 
        <menu>
          <li>
            OGG is a multimedia container that can hold all kinds of compression formats. Vorbis was first released in 2000 and grew in popularity due to two reasons: 1) it adheres to the principles of open source software, and 2) it performs significantly better than most other lossy compression formats (meaning it produces a smaller file size for equivalent audio quality).
          </li>
          <li>
            FLAC: The Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) is the most popular lossless format, making it a good choice if you want to store your music in lossless. Unlike WAV and AIFF, it's been compressed, so it takes up a lot less space. However, it's still a lossless format, which means the audio quality is still the same as the original source, so it's much better for listening than WAV and AIFF. It's also free and open source, which is handy if you're into that sort of thing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Opus: Opus is a lossy audio coding format developed by the Xiph.Org Foundation and standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force, designed to efficiently code speech and general audio in a single format, while remaining low-latency enough for real-time interactive communication and low-complexity enough for low-end embedded processors.

      <h3>
      Video: MP4 vs. WebM vs. Ogg
      </h3>
      <menu>
        <li>
        MP4: MPEG-4 is the HTML5 supported file format that has been around longest. Version 1 debuted in 2001 as one of the earliest digital video file formats. In a time when digital data was beginning to replace mechanical video tapes in mass, MPEG-4 became a wildly popular file format. However, its span means that it was not designed with today, and tomorrow’s, internet in mind. The smartest phone available in 2001 was Palm’s Kyocera 6035, and one of its strongest selling points was (limited) web browsing.
        </li>
        <menu>
          <li>
          Full codec name: Moving Picture Experts Group 4
          </li>
          <li>
          Browser compatibility: Chrome 3, Edge 12, Firefox, Internet Explorer 9, Opera 24, Safari 3.1
          </li>
          <li>
          Advantages: General purpose video
          </li>
          <li>
          Disadvantages: MP4 files are not easy to edit or update
          </li>
          <li>
          File extensions: .mp4
          </li>
        </menu>
        <li>
        WebM: WebM is a completely open source video format, which meshes well with the current and future state of the internet. It debuted in 2010 and was designed and developed with widespread web use and sharing in mind. Many of WebM’s features were created with an eye towards the future, including the file format’s low computational footprint. It delivers the highest quality video it can in real time, adjusting file weight depending on connection and processing power. Despite its recent development and release, however, WebM (currently) has the same HTML5 browser incompatibilities as OGV (WebM’s one advantage being its compatibility with Chrome on Android devices).
        </li>
        <menu>
          <li>
          Full codec name: Web Media
          </li>
          <li>
          Browser compatibility: Chrome 6, Edge 173 (desktop only), Firefox 4, Opera 10.6, Safari (WebRTC only)
          </li>
          <li>
          Advantages: General purpose video, preferably in an open format
          </li>
          <li>
          Disadventages: browser compatibility, however 86% of 4chan's visits come from browsers that include full or partial support for WebM, and plug-ins are available for those that don't (like Internet Explorer and Safari)
          </li>
          <li>
          File extensions: .webm
          </li>
        </menu>
        <li>
        Ogg: OGG was originally designed as an audio compression package in the early ‘90s but matured over the next two decades. What started as a workaround led OGG to give birth to OGV, a digital multimedia file format redesigned for efficient streaming over the internet. However, the format’s longevity does not guarantee success in an ever-changing future. The format does not (currently) work with any version of Internet Explorer nor Safari - not to mention today’s most popular mobile devices.
        </li>

          Full codec name: Ogg

          <li>
          Browser compatibility: Chrome 3, Firefox 3.5, Edge 173 (desktop only), Internet Explorer 9, Opera 10.50
          </li>
          <li>
          Advantages: free and open format; defines patent unencumbered media data formats; support older versions of Firefox and Chrome which don't yet support WebM
          </li>
          <li>
          Disadventages: never gained the wide support needed to make it a good first choice for a media container; better using WebM.
